I describe myself as a Full Stack Developer not because I know how to do everything but because I worked in different position over the years so I don't like to use a specific job title. 
What's keeps me attached to this profession are the endless ways to do a specific task. There is always something new to try and experiment 
and if you get stuck somewhere you know there is some way out. I started as a backend developer and now I work as a React developer using AWS for all the needs. 
I don't have particular preferences, everything depends on the project. What I learned on my experience is that If I'm motivated I can master all the required skills for the project.
